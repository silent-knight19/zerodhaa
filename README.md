## Project Overview

**Zerodhaa** is a multi-part web application split into `frontend`, `backend` and an admin `dashboard`. The repo is organized as a monorepo where each part is a self-contained Node/JavaScript project. The intent is to provide a full-stack solution backed by a REST (or GraphQL) API and a modern single-page frontend plus an administrative dashboard.

> Tip: If you are the repo owner, replace the placeholder sections below (features, envs) with exact values from the codebase — this README is designed to be copy-paste friendly.

## Repository Structure

```
/ (root)
├─ frontend/        # React app (Create React App / Vite — check package.json)
├─ backend/         # Node.js + Express (or similar) API
├─ dashboard/       # Admin dashboard (React or separate frontend)
├─ .vscode/
├─ package.json     # monorepo helper scripts (optional)
└─ package-lock.json
```

Each folder should contain its own `package.json`. Commands below assume this layout.

## Tech Stack

This is an inferred/common stack for this repo structure — verify with the individual `package.json` files:

* Frontend: React (CRA / Vite), JavaScript/TypeScript, CSS
* Backend: Node.js, Express (or similar), MongoDB (or any other DB), Mongoose (possible)
* Dashboard: React-based admin UI
* Authentication: JWT-based token auth (likely)
* Dev tooling: npm / npx

## Features (expected / common)

*Be sure to edit this list if your project does different things.*

* User registration, authentication (email/password, JWT)
* CRUD APIs for core resources
* File upload / static asset handling
* Admin dashboard for managing users, content, or app settings
* Role-based access control (user / admin)

## Getting Started — Local Development

### Prerequisites

* Node.js (v16+ recommended)
* npm (v8+) or yarn
* MongoDB (local or MongoDB Atlas) or other database the `backend` expects
* Git (to clone the repo)

### Install & run (monorepo)

Open a terminal at the repo root and run:

```bash
# clone
git clone https://github.com/silent-knight19/zerodhaa.git
cd zerodhaa

# install dependencies for each workspace
cd backend && npm install
cd ../frontend && npm install
cd ../dashboard && npm install
```

Then start each part in its own terminal. Typical commands (replace with what's in each package.json):

```bash
# backend
cd backend
npm run dev            # or npm start

# frontend
cd ../frontend
npm start

# dashboard
cd ../dashboard
npm start
```

If the repo uses a root-level `package.json` with scripts orchestrating everything, check `npm run` in the root.

### Run frontend only

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

The frontend will commonly run at `http://localhost:3000` (CRA) or `5173` (Vite). Check your terminal output.

### Run backend only

```bash
cd backend
npm install
cp .env.example .env   # if a template is provided
# edit .env with DB connection string and secrets
npm run dev             # nodemon / node
```

API will usually run at `http://localhost:5000` or `http://localhost:4000`.

### Run dashboard/admin only

```bash
cd dashboard
npm install
npm start
```

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the `backend` folder (and in `frontend`/`dashboard` if required). Typical variables the backend will expect (edit to match actual code):

```
# backend/.env
PORT=5000
NODE_ENV=development
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/zerodhaa
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_here
CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:3000

# frontend/.env (if React Vite or CRA expects a prefix)
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000

# dashboard/.env
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
```

> Replace `MONGO_URI` and `JWT_SECRET` with production-safe values when deploying.

## Architecture & How the Pieces Fit

High-level flow:

* The **frontend** is the public-facing SPA that calls the **backend** API endpoints to read/write data.
* The **backend** handles authentication, business logic, and database access. It typically exposes REST endpoints under `/api/*`.
* The **dashboard** is a separate app (or route within frontend) that requires admin privileges and manages app data.

Simple ASCII diagram:

```
[Browser] <--HTTPS--> [Frontend SPA]  <---HTTP-->  [Backend API]  <---TCP--->  [Database]
                                              |
                                              +--> [File storage / S3]
                                              +--> [External APIs]
```

Security notes:

* Keep `JWT_SECRET` and DB credentials out of source control.
* CORS should be configured in backend to allow only the client origins.

## Build & Deployment

A typical deployment flow:

1. Build frontend and dashboard into static bundles:

```bash
cd frontend && npm run build   # outputs into build/ or dist/
cd dashboard && npm run build
```

2. Serve static files via a CDN, Netlify, Vercel or behind a Node server or Nginx.
3. Deploy backend to any Node hosting: Heroku, DigitalOcean App Platform, AWS ECS / Elastic Beanstalk, or a container.
4. Use environment variables in the host environment for secrets.

For simple setups, you can serve the frontend build from the backend `express.static` middleware.

## Testing

If test scripts exist, run them inside each package folder:

```bash
cd backend && npm test
cd frontend && npm test
```

Add unit / integration tests where appropriate.

## Troubleshooting & Common Issues

* `Cannot connect to DB` — verify `MONGO_URI`, that MongoDB is running, and no firewall blocks the port.
* `CORS` errors — ensure backend CORS config allows your frontend origin (e.g. `http://localhost:3000`).
* `Port already in use` — change `PORT` in `.env` or the start script.
* Missing secrets — ensure `.env` exists or environment variables set in your host.

## Contributing

Thanks for wanting to contribute! Keep contributions focused and modular.

1. Fork the repo
2. Create a branch: `git checkout -b feat/some-feature`
3. Make changes & add tests
4. Run the app locally and verify
5. Create a PR with a clear description of what you changed and why
